<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>GiveMeCredit is a cryptocurrency where you must earn trust and contribute value in order for money (credits) to be created.</h2>
<h3>Please clone the repo and load the extension into chrome by visiting chrome://extensions/ and then click 'Load unpacked extension'. Then, once enabled, open the index.html file in your browser to see a demo + further instructions.</h3>

<p>If it is installed, you should also see the following widget :-</p>
<p><a href="">http://gmc@0481f1010a5b0147e764aa59741ef923396322e211bb5decf3fbc493821245e6df74494fd11a4bfbb8a594cbd5a31015d8601b748fd34d70dfa20830f33c62be40.com</a></p>

<h4>STEP 1:</h4>
<p>Click on the icon (top right) and register.</p>
<p>The registration process simply generates a pair of keys (similar to a username and password). You will need to provide a url to your profile picture. I have pre-populated the form for testing purposes.</p>

<h4>STEP 2:</h4>
<p>Login</p>

<h4>STEP 3:</h4>
<p>Click on the profile picture on the toolbar and edit your info. For testing purposes, give yourself a comment also.</p>


<h4>STEP 4:</h4>

<p>Earn a Silver Credit by rating this page using the toolbar below.</p>
<p>You can check the console to see the verification process. Each time you do anything such as setup an account, vote or give credit to someone, a new signature is created. However, for transactions, this signature will be the transactionID. I did it this way in order to reduce the transaction size. It may take a few seconds to create the signature. It's sort of like a 'proof-of-work' as it must find a signature where the last x number of characters must match the first x number of characters.</p>


<h4>STEP 5:</h4>

<p>Give someone credit. For testing purposes, setup a new account but don't login! Instead copy the public key from the login form, go to the index.html file and paste the public key i.e. http://gmc@[paste here].com. You can now give credit from your logged in account to the new account.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can use the following url for the profile picture :- https://openmerchantaccount.com/img2/WDF_1048452.jpg</p>
<p>NOTE: Profile images must be served over https. You can upload an image to:- httpsimage.com if you want</p>


<h4>STEP 6:</h4>

<p>Ask other users to give you a profile reference. This is not necessary for testing puposes. However, once the app is in production, you will need a profile score of >= 3.5. Also, you will need at least 3 references in order to be given Gold Credits. And each reference must have a profile score of >= 3.5. This is 1 level deep. As the network grows, this will drop to 2 levels deep. By that i mean you will need 3 references with a score of >= 3.5, and those 3 references will each need 3 references of >= 3.5. It could go deeper still. The whole point is to ensure that users cannot create a network of accounts and give themselves credits.</p>

<h4>STEP 7:</h4>
<p>Copy your profile link (given to you after registration) and paste it next to something you want credit for.</p>


<h4>STEP 8:</h4>
<p>Ask people to give you credit!</p>
