STEP 1:

Click on the icon (top right) and register.

The registration process simply generates a pair of keys (similar to a username and password). You will need to provide a url to your profile picture. I have pre-populated the form for testing purposes.

STEP 2:

Login

STEP 3:

Click on the profile picture on the toolbar and edit your info. For testing purposes, give yourself a comment also.

STEP 4:

Earn a Silver Credit by rating this page using the toolbar below.

You can check the console to see the verification process. Each time you do anything such as setup an account, vote or give credit to someone, a new signature is created. However, for transactions, this signature will be the transactionID. I did it this way in order to reduce the transaction size. It may take a few seconds to create the signature. It's sort of like a 'proof-of-work' as it must find a signature where the last x number of characters must match the first x number of characters.

STEP 5:

Give someone credit. For testing purposes, setup a new account but don't login! Instead copy the public key from the login form, go to the index.html file and paste the public key i.e. http://gmc@[paste here]. You can now give credit from your logged in account to the new account.

NOTE: You can use the following url for the profile picture :- http://pic.1fotonin.com/data/wallpapers/59/WDF_1048452.jpg

STEP 6:

Ask other users to give you a profile reference. This is not necessary for testing puposes. However, once the app is in production, you will need a profile score of >= 3.5. Also, you will need at least 3 references in order to be given Gold Credits. And each reference must have a profile score of >= 3.5. This is 1 level deep. As the network grows, this will drop to 2 levels deep. By that i mean you will need 3 references with a score of >= 3.5, and those 3 references will each need 3 references of >= 3.5. It could go deeper still. The whole point is to ensure that users cannot create a network of accounts and give themselves credits.

STEP 7:

Copy your profile link (given to you after registration) and paste it next to something you want credit for.

STEP 8:

Ask people to give you credit!
