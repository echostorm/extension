<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h2>GiveMeCredit is a cryptocurrency where you must earn trust and contribute value in order for money (credits) to be created.</h2>
<p>My intention is to use GiveMeCredit a local currency, with the intention of financing local activities/services. If it works, then i will expand.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot.</p>

<p>If you have installed the extension, you should see the widget here...</p>

<p>NOTE: The demo currently uses ForerunnerDB.</p>
<hr />
GiveMeCredit has three main features:-
<ul>
<li>
A toolbar for rating content
</li>
<li>
A GiveMeCredit widget. You simply paste your link somewhere (i.e. http://gmc@0481f1010a5b0147e764aa59741ef923396322e.com), which is converted into a widget by the extension and allows you to receive credits.
</li>
<li>
A public profile
</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, when you rate content, you earn silver credits. And when you donate those silver credits to someone else, they become gold credits. There are lots of rules but here are a few to give you an idea :-</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to earn 10 silver credits in order to give 1 gold credit</li>
<li>The value of a gold credit is relative to the current page score. For example, if your page/content has a score of 75%, then the value of the credit that you receive will be Â©0.75.</li>
<li>Your item will need at least 20 up votes in order to receive gold credits</li>
<li>A Silver credit will expire after 3 months</li>
<li>A Gold credit will expire after 3 years</li>
<li>You need a profile score greater than 3.5 in order to receive gold credits (and maybe take into account the scores of those who assigned you that score).</li>
<li>Each user must have a custom "vanity" address (public key), which will be generated by a separate application. In this case the first 4 characters of the address must match the last 4 characters, i.e. 322e1010a5b0147e764aa59741ef923396322e. It will take some time to generate a public/private key pair in this format and will thus help prevent users setting up fake accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Currently there are only Silver Credits and Gold Credits, however, I am considering incorporating bronse credits. So, you vote on content and earn bronze credits instead. Then, these bronze credits will be converted into silver credits when you donate them. However, you will also have the option (via a select box) to give silver credits, which become gold credits. This simply adds an additional layer of trust to the credits. It's easy to earn bronze, harder to earn silver, and harder still to earn gold.</p>
<hr />
<h4>STEP 1:</h4>
<p>Click on the icon (top right) and register.</p>
<p>The registration process simply generates a pair of keys (similar to a username and password). You will need to provide a url to your profile picture. I have pre-populated the form for testing purposes.</p>

<h4>STEP 2:</h4>
<p>Login</p>

<h4>STEP 3:</h4>
<p>Click on the profile picture on the toolbar and edit your info. For testing purposes, give yourself a comment also.</p>


<h4>STEP 4:</h4>

<p>Earn a Silver Credit by rating this page using the toolbar below. NOTE: Normally you would needs at least 10 silver credits in order to give 1 gold credit but for testing purposes this check has been omitted.</p>
<p>You can check the console to see the verification process. Each time you do anything such as setup an account, vote or give credit to someone, a new signature is created. However, for transactions, this signature will be the transactionID. I did it this way in order to reduce the transaction size. It may take a few seconds to create the signature. It's sort of like a 'proof-of-work' as it must find a signature where the last x number of characters must match the first x number of characters.</p>


<h4>STEP 5:</h4>

<p>Give someone credit. For testing purposes, setup a new account but don't login! Instead copy the public key from the login form, go to the index.html file and paste the public key i.e. http://gmc@[paste here].com. You can now give credit from your logged in account to the new account.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can use the following url for the profile picture :- https://openmerchantaccount.com/img2/WDF_1048452.jpg</p>
<p>NOTE: Profile images must be served over https. You can upload an image to:- httpsimage.com if you want</p>


<h4>STEP 6:</h4>

<p>Ask other users to give you a profile reference. This is not necessary for testing puposes. However, once the app is in production, you will need a profile score of >= 3.5. Also, you will need at least 3 references in order to be given Gold Credits. And each reference must have a profile score of >= 3.5. This is 1 level deep. As the network grows, this will drop to 2 levels deep. By that i mean you will need 3 references with a score of >= 3.5, and those 3 references will each need 3 references of >= 3.5. It could go deeper still. The whole point is to ensure that users cannot create a network of accounts and give themselves credits.</p>

<h4>STEP 7:</h4>
<p>Copy your profile link (given to you after registration) and paste it next to something you want credit for.</p>


<h4>STEP 8:</h4>
<p>Ask people to give you credit!</p>
